## Launch Visual Acad UI

Make sure you have Node.js, `nvm`, and `npm` installed. 

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then in `LLM-UI/`, run `npm start` to start the react webpage host. The UI webpage will be hosted on http://localhost:3000. You can paste this address in browser to view it.

The UI reads the flowchart description file from example.js. You can modify this file to create a new flowchart.
